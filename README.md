## Overview

The expt uses GMM-based synthetic sampling on the credit card transactions dataset by [mlg-ulb](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). \
A baseline model is evaluated (logistic regression) on the imbalanced dataset. \
2 methods are used: 
- Oversampling using GMM
- Undersampling using clustering + Oversampling using GMM

gmm_synthetic_sampling.pdf summarizes all the results in a PDF.
